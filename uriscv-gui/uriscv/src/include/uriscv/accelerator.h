/*
 We use the term accelerator to refer to either a non-programmable
fixed-function unit or a core that can operate autonomously but is specialized
for certain tasks. In RISC-V systems, we expect many programmable accelerators
will be RISC-V-based cores with specialized instruction-set extensions and/or
customized coprocessors. An important class of RISC-V accelerators are I/O
accelerators, which offload I/O processing tasks from the main application
cores.
