A RISC - V hardware platform can contain one or
    more RISC - V - compatible processing cores together with other non - RISC -
        V - compatible cores,
    fixed - function accelerators, various physical memory structures,
    I / O devices,
    and an interconnect structure to allow the components to communicate
            .A component is termed a core if it contains an independent
                instruction fetch unit.A RISC -
        V - compatible core might support multiple RISC - V -
        compatible hardware threads,
    or harts, through multithreading.
